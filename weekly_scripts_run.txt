🔁 1. Machine Learning (ML):
✅weekly_learning.py
📌 Retrains the intent classifier using Training_data.json.

📦 Adds real-world examples collected throughout the week.

🔁 This is the core of the bot's continuous improvement!

🧱 2. Update Products:
✅ export_products.py
📦 Exports active products with inventory to products.json from the Shopify API.

✅ build_scraped_usages.py
🔍 Scrapes the USAGE field from the frontend of each product.

🧠 Saves to scraped_usages.json only if it isn't already scraped.

⚠️ Only runs after export_products.py.

📄 3. Update informational pages:
✅ utils.py (get_shopify_pages() function)
🔄 This is used automatically when you run server.py or search_pages, so you don't need to run anything manual.

⚠️ Just make sure not to delete pages.json if future logic uses it as a cache.

📰 4. Update blog articles:
✅ build_articles.py
🧠 Use the Shopify API to save published articles to articles.json.

⚡ Fast and reliable. No more scraping. No BeautifulSoup required.
